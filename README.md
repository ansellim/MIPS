# MIPS
Some simple MIPS code written for TIC2401 Introduction to Computer Systems

`arraycount.asm` and `messages.asm` are programs written for Assignment 1 (see `questions.pdf`)

I also include a term paper I wrote in which I adapted the MIPS architecture in a small way to create a new processor design.
